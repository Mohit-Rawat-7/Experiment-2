# Experiment 2
## Program 1
### Aim:
To display the size of each primitive data type in C++.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

## Theory:
In C++, primitive data types are the basic types that come built into the language. They include:

int: For storing integers.
float: For storing single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: For storing double-precision floating-point numbers.
char: For storing single characters.
bool: For storing boolean values (true or false).
The sizeof operator in C++ helps determine the size of these data types, variables, and constants at compile time.

### Output:
The program will show the sizes of the above data types in bytes.

### Conclusion:
We explored and displayed the sizes of different primitive data types in C++.

## Program 2
### Aim:
To demonstrate the use of storage classes in C++.

### Software Used:
Visual Studio Code

## Theory:
Storage classes in C++ determine the visibility and lifetime of variables and functions:

auto: Automatically deduces the type of a variable. It lets the compiler figure out the type based on the assigned value.
register: Suggests storing the variable in a CPU register for quicker access. This is just a suggestion, not a command.
static: Limits the scope of a variable to the file, function, or block where it's defined but keeps its value between function calls.
extern: Indicates that a variable or function is defined in another file or later in the same file, allowing for sharing across files.
Output:
The program will demonstrate the effects and behaviors of different storage classes.

### Conclusion:
We learned about storage classes in C++ and how they affect variable scope and lifetime.
